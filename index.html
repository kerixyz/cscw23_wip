                CSCW is the premier international venue for research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. We invite authors to submit their best research on all topics relevant to collaborative or social computing. Accepted papers are published in two annual CSCW issues of the journal series Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction (PACM HCI).
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                CSCW 2023 will follow the half-yearly submission model implemented in CSCW 2022. Thus, new paper submissions will be only possible for the July 2022 and January 2023 deadlines.

                Word authors: Because CSCW papers are published in PACM HCI that uses the Sheridan service, authors need to use the old interim ACM Small template, which is no longer published on ACM websites. Please use the following link to access the templates: <a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates">https://dl.acm.org/journal/pacmhci/submission-templates</a>

            <p class="text">
                No minimum or maximum length is imposed on papers. Rather, reviewers will be instructed to weigh the contribution of a paper relative to its length. Typical papers are under 10,000 words.

            <p class="text">
                Note: Valuable but concise contributions are welcome as short papers. Shorter, more focused papers will be reviewed with the expectation of a small, focused contribution. Papers whose length is incommensurate with their contribution will be rejected.

            <h2 class="add-top-margin">Anonymous Review Policy</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
                Papers are subject to anonymous reviewing. Submissions must have authors’ names and affiliations removed and avoid obvious identifying statements. Any grant information that identifies the author(s) and their institution should be removed as well. Papers that violate this policy will be desk rejected. Please check in particular the front page, headers and footers, Acknowledgement section, AND meta-data of the submitted file.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Citations to authors’ own relevant work should NOT be anonymous, but rather should be done without identifying the authors. For example, “Prior work by [authors]” instead of “In our prior work.”
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                CSCW does not have a policy against uploading preprints to SSRN or arXiv before they are submitted for review at the conference.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Nevertheless, to ensure the integrity of the peer review process, we ask that no authors publicize the work until that process is complete. Please do not share any confidential info specific to a current review process publicly* or on social media. (*Exception: Doing public exhibitions, festivals, and performances as part of the research where the name is integral to the work).
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                We also ask the reviewers to refrain from taking steps to learn about the author’s identity during the peer review process.

            <h2 class="add-top-margin">Decisions and Deadlines</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="text">
                CSCW will be returning submissions to the primary contact author with one of the following decisions, along with the reviews, roughly 11 weeks from the initial submission. For the CSCW July 2022 submission deadline, we hope to send out notifications on September 30th, 2022. Review turnaround for accepted papers and final checks will be shorter:

                <ul>
                  <li> Accept: Submissions that receive this decision are ready or nearly ready for publication, though they may require a few small changes. The final version of the paper must be submitted in the next deadline (or earlier) for verification by the corresponding associate chair. The submission will appear in an upcoming issue of the PACM HCI.</li>
                  <li> Minor revision: Submissions that receive this decision will require some revisions before being accepted for publication. The revised submission MUST be submitted within the next deadline, along with a brief response to the reviewers’ comments. The revision will be verified by the corresponding associate chair and if approved, the submission will be promoted to an accepted paper.</li>
                  <li> Major revision: Submissions that receive this decision have real potential, but will require major portions rewritten or redone, and then re-reviewed. Given the amount of effort that should be invested in a major revision, the earliest resubmission of a revised major revision is after two deadlines of the initial submission. Latest submission will also be acceptable three deadlines after the initial submission. For example, a July 2022 submission receiving a Major Revision decision can be first resubmitted to the January 2023 deadline and must be resubmitted by the April 2023 deadline at the latest. The authors must ensure that the paper has been revised sufficiently to warrant re-review. To the extent possible, resubmissions will be assigned the same AC and reviewers for re-review. Upon re-review, submissions can receive one of two decisions: Accept with minor revisions or Reject. Unlike most journals, the current CSCW review process does NOT allow for more than one major revision recommendation due to reviewer availability and time constraints.</li>
                  <li> Reject: Authors of rejected papers are allowed to resubmit their papers in the next cycle as a new submission after receiving the Reject decision. For example, if the paper was rejected after a submission in July 2022, authors can re-submit the paper as a new submission in the following January 2023 cycle. However, papers resubmitted with no or marginal changes will be desk rejected without review. Authors must describe the paper’s submission history and briefly outline the changes in a designated field in PCS when resubmitting. Failure to disclose the paper’s submission history may lead to a desk reject decision. ACs and reviewers will have access to this description of the paper’s submission history and may also request to review the detailed submission history.</li>
                  <li>Desk / Quick Reject: Authors should only submit completed work of publishable quality and within the scope of ACM CSCW. The ACs and Editors may Quick Reject any submission that they believe has little chance of being accepted if it goes through the peer review process. Incomplete or otherwise inappropriate submissions will be desk rejected without review.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                      <li>Authors directly contact the Papers Chairs to officially appeal a decision</li>
                      <li>A committee member (1 AC / 2AC / Editor / Papers Chair) raises an issue about the decision or decision-making process, possibly in response to a communication from an author </li>
                    </ul>
                  <li>The appeal involves motivating the case with evidence</li>
                  <li>Papers Chairs assess the situation and make an initial call to bring it up for discussion with the Editors</li>
                  <li>The Editor assigned to the submission reviews the paper, the reviews, and the discussion in PCS to determine if the case is valid. The Editor may choose to involve the ACs at this stage</li>
                  <li>Other Editors weigh in and review the case</li>
                  <li>The Editors come to a collective decision and share their decision with the Papers Chairs</li>
                  <li>The Papers Chairs discuss the Editors’ decision. If a change is agreed, Papers Chairs record the updated decision in PCS</li>
                  <li>The Papers Chairs communicate the final decision to the authors</li>
                  <li>If the authors are dissatisfied with the outcome of this process, the case will then be referred to the CSCW Steering Committee</li>

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
                When uploading the paper to the PCS reviewing system, authors will be able to indicate the primary research paradigm of their paper for appropriate reviewer assignment:

                <ul>
                  <li>Technical/Systems, e.g., building novel systems, algorithms, implementing novel features in existing systems, etc.</li>
                  <li>Empirical-Qualitative, e.g., ethnography, workplace studies, qualitative user studies, etc.</li>
                  <li>Empirical-Quantitative, e.g., “big data,” quantitative user studies, statistical methods, etc.</li>
                  <li>Mixed Methods, e.g., combined qualitative and quantitative empirical research, design explorations combined with technical feature development.</li>
                  <li>Design, e.g., design implications, guidelines, methods, techniques, etc.</li>
                  <li>Theoretical, e.g., conceptual frameworks, theory underpinning CSCW studies/domains, theoretical analysis, and essays.</li>
